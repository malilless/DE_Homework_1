# Homework 1 - Working with Nested JSON Data
## 1. Dataset Selection
* I chose the dataset I was working with during another SQL course in KSE (Databases, autumn 2025).
* Here's the link: https://github.com/vintagedon/steam-dataset-2025/tree/main.

## 2. Data Loading
* In DataGrip, I set up a local DuckDB instance by creating a database file called identifier.db.
* Then loaded the data using the "read_json_auto" function and created a table called "games".
